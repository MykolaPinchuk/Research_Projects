This is a repo for a project "Prediciting the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns using Machine Learning".

The objective of this project is to achieve higher predictive accuracy in estimating expected returns of the cross-section of public US firms. I use modern machine learning approaches and show that they outperform commonly used in academia linear regression by the factor of 5-6.
