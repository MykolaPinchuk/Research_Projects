"MLEAP_feb20" is the latest version of the paper.

The main script to generate results is "eapml_35.R".
It uses the data on stock characteristics from "IMLEAP_v2.csv".
This file contains merged CRSP and Compustat datasets over 1964-2018, obtained from WRDS research database. 
Since WRDS is a subscription-based service, I can not post the data here.
